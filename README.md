Various code snippets and sometimes directions about where code is located.
These are primarily python ipynb files about various aspects of math.  Indeed, most of the files .ipynb are jupyter notebook files which include an amalgamation of markdown and python code.  Not all of the markdown is original writing.  Most of it is original and written by me, but sometimes parts are lifted, with or without attribution from sources such as mathstackexchange. 

The purpose of these files is personal notes and education.  They are not intended for any kind of publication and they are pretty much unorganized and useless.  Such is especially the case insofar as they are not indexed or even searchable except with great difficulty.
