    "<h3>With a circle, the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of tangency is equal to the angle made by the chord in the alternate segment.</h3>\n",
    "This lemma is harder to understand than it is to prove.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a chord goes through a circle and misses the center point, then it creates two arcs (by arc we also mean segments of the circle) of unequal length (i.e. the segments are of unequal size).  Now suppose that one end of the chord passes through a tangent point coming from an external point, $P,$ and that the other end of the chord goes to any point, $A,$ in the alternate segment of the circle.  Then, the angle between the first chord and the tangent point is equal to the angle between point $A$ and the two ends of the chord.\n",
