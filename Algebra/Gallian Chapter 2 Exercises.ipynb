    "  5\\cdot 25 &\\equiv 25\\pmod{40}\n",
    " \\end{align}$$\n",
    " To be a group, we need to establish associativity. The given set has an Cayley table with 16 multiplications modulo 40.  $$f(a,b)\\equiv r\\pmod{40}$$ In particular, the function is $$f(a)=r=a-40\\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{40}\\right\\rfloor$$  Since function composition is associative, the group is associative.\n",
    "    \n",
    " Lastly, we need to show that every element has an inverse.  This is a little unusual because the identity element is not 1 but rather 25.  We need to show that some members of the set, $a,$ when multiplied by each element will get $25\\bmod{ 40}.$  We actually did this when we found the identity element.\n",
