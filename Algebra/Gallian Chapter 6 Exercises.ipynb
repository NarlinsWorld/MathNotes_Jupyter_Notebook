    "For some functions, the definition is simplest: show that if you have $a$ and $b$ in the domain such that $f(a)=f(b)$, then you can conclude that $a=b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some functions, the contrapositive of the definition is simplest: show that if $a$ and $b$ are in the domain and $a\\neq b$, then $f(a)\\neq f(b)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For yet other functions, it is easier to prove they are one-to-one by showing that they have a left inverse: that is, if $f\\colon X\\to Y$, then coming up with a function $g\\colon Y\\to X$ such that $g\\circ f = \\mathrm{id}_X$, the identity of $X$; this immediately implies that $f$ is one-to-one. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the sets have other structure, there may be other tools available (showing that a *linear transformation* is one-to-one can be done by showing that if $T(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{0}$, then $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$, for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "Which one is easiest? Depends on the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the easiest way to show that a function is not one-to-one? The *absolutely*, *definitely*  **best** way is to exhibit two *specific* elements in the domain, $a$ and $b$, showing that $a\\neq b$, and then showing that $f(a)\\neq f(b)$. In fact, I would say that 99% of the \"proofs that a function is not one-to-one\" should at the very list *end* with such an explicit example. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you *find* such examples? Again, it depends on the function. Sometimes you try to see if the function is one-to-one by considering what you can conclude if $f(a)=f(b)$; this will lead you to a relationship between $a$ and $b$, and often you can see that the relation can be satisfied with $a\\neq b$. This will lead you to an example. For instance, to show that $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x^2$ is not one-to-one, you could go through the following thought process:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"I wonder if it is one to one... let's see... if $f(a)=f(b)$, then this means that $a^2=b^2$; taking square roots, that says that $|a|=|b|$... ah! but that can happen even if $a\\neq b$! For instance, if $a=-b$... Okay, so here's a proof that $f$ is not one-to-one: take $a=1$, $b=-1$. Then $a\\neq b$, and $f(a)=f(1) = 1$, $f(b)=f(-1) = 1$. So $f(a)=f(b)$, and this shows that $f$ is not one-to-one.\"\n",
