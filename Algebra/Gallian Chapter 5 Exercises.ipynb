    "<h3>Even or Odd</h3> Having written a permutation in cycle notation, it can futher be written in 'transpositions'. Do it like this: $$(a b c d)=(a b)(b c)(c d)$$ Compose each of the disjoint cycles as transpositions and string them all together. For example, $$(a b c)(d e f g)=(a b)(b c)(d e)(e f)(f g)$$ If the number of transpositions is odd, then the cycle is odd.  If it is even, then the cycle is even\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are an odd number of elements in a single cycle, it composes into an even number of transpostions, and vice versa.  So for example if some permutation when written in disjoint cycle form has a (cycle of 27 elements)(cycle of 14 elements)(cycle of 6 elements), then we have: $$27\\rightarrow \\text{even number of transpositions}$$  $$14\\rightarrow \\text{odd no. of transp.}$$ $$6\\rightarrow \\text{odd no. of transp.}$$ Since (27+14+6)=47 total transpositions is an odd number, the permutation will be odd.\n",
