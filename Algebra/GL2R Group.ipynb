    "General Linear group of 2x2 invertible matrices with real numbers.<br>\n",
    "We would like to prove that this is a group.<br><br>\n",
    "To be invertible, we are saying that the the determinant is nonzero.\n",
    "$$\\text{Det}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} a&b\\\\ c&d \\end{array}  \\right] \\Rightarrow ab-cd\\ne 0$$\n",
    "From linear algebra we know that $$\\text{det}\\left( AB \\right)=\\text{det}(A)\\text{det}(B)$$\n",
    "* Since both $A$ and $B$ are nonzero, their product is necessarily nonzero, and thus they are invertible, which shows that we have $\\color{red}{\\text{closure under the operation}}$.\n",
    "* The identity matrix is $$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1&0\\\\ 0&1 \\end{array}  \\right]$$ and its determinant is $1$, therefore it is invertible and is in the set.\n",
    "* Associativity is inherited from the operation and is true for any 2x2 matrices. $$A(BC)=(AB)C$$\n",
    "* Next we show that the inverse exists and is in the set for all $A^{-1}$.  To form the inverse of a 2x2 matrix, \n",
    "$$A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}d&-b\\\\ -c&a \\end{array}  \\right]$$<br>\n",
    "The 2x2 inverse is formed by 1/det(A) times a 2x2 formed from A. [We flip terms on the diagonal, and negate terms off the diagonal.]<br>\n",
    "Since $\\text{det}(A)\\ne 0$, $\\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)}\\ne 0$\n",
    "To show that $A^{-1}$ is in the set, we have to show that its determinant is not zero. Since $\\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)}$ is a scaler we can call it $\\alpha$ and show $$A^{-1}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\alpha d& -\\alpha b\\\\ -\\alpha c& \\alpha a \\end{array}  \\right]$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Det}(A^{-1})=\\alpha^2ad-\\alpha^2cb$$\n",
    "$$=\\alpha^2 \\text{det}( A )=\\left( \\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)^2} \\text{det}(A)\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\text{det}(A)}$$ which we have already shown to be nonzero.  Therefore, the inverse is closed in the set. $\\qquad\\qquad\\blacksquare$"
