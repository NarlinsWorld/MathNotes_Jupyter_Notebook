    "<h1>Ramsey Numbers</h1>\n",
    "Sometimes we don't like to think about something because in English the thoughts are just difficult to express.  It's not that they are difficult to understand, but rather that having understood one case doesn't guarantee that the next case will be any easier. The first such example that comes to mind is called \"double negatives\". Take the sentence \"I don't know nothing about it.\"  The speaker probably means that he is clueless.  However, he said that he knows something about it!  \n",

    "A phrase from a Bill Withers song, \"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.\"  After unscrambling, it means \"She's gone and the sun is still shining - to bad about her.\"  Two more song title example are \"We don't need no education\" by Pink Floyd and \"Never gonna not dance again\" by Pink.  Pink, clearly got it right as she is dancing constantly.  Pink Floyd - probably not, although its subtle, since the title suggests that some education would be beneficial.   \n",

    "Ramsey Numbers fall into this category of thinking, where everytime we encounter the concept, some careful thought is required. Suppose we draw a few dots on paper and then connect every dot to every other dot with a line. To avoid having curved lines, we will arrange the dots at the corners of regular polygons and call the connecting lines edges. When there is only 1 dot, no meaningful edge is possible. Two dots permit 1 edge between them.  Three dots get us a triangle. So far, pretty boring.  Four dots, with every dot connected to every other dot has 6 edges.  This is easiest to see if you arrange the dots to form a square, but it remains true regardless of orientation. The easiest dot orientation to consider is a regular polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon etc.) which after 8 or 9 dots begins to look like a circle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So how many edges are needed to connect every dot to every other dot? \n",
    "    $$\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\n",
    "    Dots & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & \\cdots & 18 &\\cdots & n\\\\\n",
    "    Edges & 0 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 10 & 15 & 21 & \\cdots & 153 &\\cdots\n",
    "    & \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n",
    "    \\end{array}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now suppose we want to use 2 colors for the edges. That is, we will arbitrarily select either blue or red to color any given edge.  How many $\\mathbf{ways}$ are there to do that?\n",

    "<h2>Notation</h2> \n",
    "    Let $K_n$ represent $n$ dots on the paper with all of the dots connected. Below I show examples of what is meant by these dot-edge objects, which we call \"komplete graphs\".\n",
    "    <img src=\"../Images/Complete Graphs.png\" width=50%>\n",
    "If you carefully count the number of lines (we call them edges) in $K_6$ you will see that there are 15, as shown in the chart above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h3>The claim</h3>\n",
    "First, I will be specific in order to ease the notation.  <br>\n",
    "The claim: If we color the edges of $K_6$ with red or blue arbitrarily, then we are guaranteed to create either a red $K_3$ or a blue $K_3$ or both.\n",
    "    \n",
    "That is an extraordinary assertion. You cannot color the edges of $K_6$ using only red and blue without creating at least one all red triangle or an all blue triangle.  In notation, we say $K_6 \\rightarrow K_3, K_3.$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now let's be more general, since we have notation. <br>\n",
    "The claim: If we color the edges of $K_n$ with red or blue arbitrarily, then we are guaranteed to create either a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$ or both.\n",
    "  $$K_n \\rightarrow K_s,K_t$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, what does it mean to say $$K_6\\rightarrow K_2,K_3$$ By and by, and not trivial, we should also ask if its true. Me and chatGPT are both quite capable of making false statements. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Interpretation of $K_6\\rightarrow K_2,K_3,$ \"If we color the edges of $K_6$ with red or blue arbitrarily, then we are guaranteed to create either a red line connecting two dots, or a blue triangle. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Really?  If we look back at the chart, there are $32\\,768$ ways to color $K_6.$  If you wish to check them all, have at it. But, consider the following logic.  If I color any edge red, then clearly there will be a red connecting two dots, ergo the claim is true if I even begin coloring with red.  However, if I color only with blue, then every triangle between any 3 dots (out of 6) will be blue. So yes, the claim is true. \n",
    "    \n",
    "These games are difficult due to the English language. Using the notation, we can make any claim and then try to determine if it is true or false. However, as $n$ gets larger, it becomes \"obvious\", as in the last example, as to the truthfulness of the claim. Also, for really small values of $n,$ the number of ways to color edges might be small enough to test them all and establish the truth that way.  But we do notice that the number of ways to color edges grows faster than exponential, so brute force won't work for long.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h2>The game</h2>\n",
    "Find $n$ as the minimum number of dots in a complete graph in order to make the claim $$K_n \\rightarrow K_3,K_3.$$ We name the answer a \"Ramsey number\" and designate it as r(3,3), which for symmetric entries is abbreviated to r(3).\n",
    "The answer to this one is $r(3)=6$ and a very simple proof exists. Although the proof is quite exciting, I won't spoil your entertainment by disclosing it.<br>\n",
    "The rules of this game are: To win, we must find $n$ and prove that it is the smallest such number.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Most of the research into this game has focused on symmetric examples as just shown. In fact we know ridiculously few of these. Here is the list.\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "K_n &\\rightarrow K_1,K_1\\qquad n=1\\text{ One dot has no edges}\\\\\n",
    "K_n &\\rightarrow K_2,K_2\\qquad n=2\\\\\n",
    "K_n &\\rightarrow K_3,K_3\\qquad n=6\\\\\n",
    "K_n &\\rightarrow K_4,K_4\\qquad n=18\\\\\n",
    "K_n &\\rightarrow K_5,K_5\\qquad n=\\text{unknown hereafter}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ramsey was a very young economist, who proved that there is a definite numeric answer for all of these going to infinity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A famous mathematician, Paul Erdos had this to say:\n",
    "    \"Imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of R(5, 5) or they will destroy our planet. In that case, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for R(6, 6). In that case, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.\""
