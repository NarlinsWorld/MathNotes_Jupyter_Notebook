    "<span class='bigblue'> Null Graph:</span> A null graph is one with no edges, only vertices. Some authors also include a graph with no vertices too, but it is less common. Example: $N_6$  is a graph with $6$ vertices and no edges.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Connected</span> When used with vertices, it just means that an edge exist between two vertices.  When used with a graph, as in \"connected graph\" it means that every vertex can be reached from any other vertex by following some edges.<br><br>\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Adjacent</span> When used with vertices, it means that there is an edge between the two vertices. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Degree</span> The degree of a vertex is a count of the number of edges coming into the vertex. The maximum degree of a graph $\\Delta G,$ and the minimum degree of a graph $\\delta G$ are the maximum and minimum of its vertices' degrees. <br><br>\n",

If $G$ is a graph, then we call $\\overline{G}$ a complement if all vertices are the same, but all edges have been complemented.

    "<span class='bigblue'> Subgraph</span> A subgraph is a subset of a graph that can be created entirely with an eraser. Any vertex or edge may be erased, but none may be created.

    "<span class='bigblue'> Clique</span> A subgraph of $G$ that is a complete graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Supergraph</span> A supergraph is a new graph created from $G$ by the addition of new vertices and new edges. No existing vertices or edges may be modified. That is, the new graph must not erase any vertex, or modify any edge.  Thus, we cannot put a new vertex onto an existing edge as that would change the adjacency definition for the existing graph.  Some authors say 'no splicing' to mean 'no new vertex on top of an existing edge. Every graph is a supergraph of itself.<br><br> \n",
    "\n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Expansion graph</span> A graph created from an existing graph solely by splicing new vertices into existing edges. Every expansion graph is an expansion graph of itself, meaning that 'make no change' can also be called an expansion. <br><br>\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Faces or Regions</span> For a connected, planar graph, drawn in the plane without edge crossings, a face of the graph is a region bounded by a set of edges and vertices. There can be many regions within a graph, but there is one that is unbounded, known as the outer face or infinite face. A two vertex, 1 edge graph has as its only face the infinite face. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Polygonal</span> A graph is polygonal if it is planar, connected, and every edge borders on two different faces. Thus $K_2$ in not polygonal, since the outer region borders the only edge on both sides. <br><br>\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Outer planar graph</span> A graph for which every vertex lies on the infinite face.<br><br>\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Bipartite Path</span> A graph that can be partitioned into two vertex sets such that elements in set A connect exclusively to elements in set B and vice versa.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " <span class='bigblue'> Complete Bipartite Graph</span>  A bibartite graph is one in which the nodes can be separated into two groups and the nodes of group A connected exclusively to the nodes of group B. A complete bipartite graph just means that all possible connections of that type have been made.  Clearly, a complete graph and a complete bipartite graph are different for $n\\ge 3.$<br>\n",
    "A complete bipartite graph can be designated as $K_{m,n}$ where $m$ indicates one group of nodes and $n$ the other. Example: $K_{1,3}$ \"the claw\" can be drawn as a central node surrounded by $3$ other nodes.\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Regular Graph</span> A graph for which all vertices have the same degree.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span class='bigblue'> Platonic graph</span> A graph that is polygonal, regular, and every face is bounded by the same number of edges. Note that this is the opposite of 'every edge borders the same number of faces'. Get them unconfused if you can. These are named for the platonic solids. See Platonic Graphs at Wikipedia for the list of 5.  <br><br>\n",

    "<span class='bigblue'> Incidence Matrix</span>List the nodes for the rows and the named edges for the columns. Every cell of an incidence matrix will be either $1$ or $0.$ If the graph is directed, $-1$ is into the node and $1$ is out of the node. <span class='blueital'>Many authors reverse the sign convention</span> It is a $1$ if the edge joins the node. Therefore, since a node has only two ends, every column in the matrix sums to 2.  Ever row in the matrix sums to the vertex degree. <br><br>\n",
